# 🧰 Proxy Web Server

A **Multi-Threaded HTTP Proxy Server** written in **C**, designed to efficiently handle multiple simultaneous client requests while improving performance through an integrated **LRU (Least Recently Used) caching system**. This project demonstrates key concepts in networking, concurrency, and caching, making it an excellent learning resource for systems programming.

---

## 🧠 Overview

The **Proxy Web Server** acts as an intermediary between clients and target web servers. It listens for HTTP requests, forwards them to the appropriate destination, and relays responses back to the clients.  
By integrating a **multi-threaded architecture** and an **LRU caching system**, the server achieves high concurrency and improved response times, significantly reducing repetitive network requests.

## ✨ Features

- 🌐 **HTTP Proxy Server:** Forwards client HTTP requests to target web servers and returns responses.  
- ⚙️ **Multi-threaded Architecture:** Handles multiple client connections simultaneously.  
- 🧠 **LRU Caching System:** Stores frequently accessed web pages to minimize redundant network requests.  
- 🔒 **Thread Synchronization:** Uses semaphores to ensure safe access to shared resources and prevent race conditions.  
- 📜 **Makefile Support:** Simplifies compilation and project management.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** C  
- **Core Concepts:** Socket Programming, Multi-threading, Synchronization with Semaphores  
- **Data Structures:** LRU Cache  
- **Build Tool:** Makefile

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Client Connection:** The server listens on the specified port and accepts multiple client connections concurrently using threads.
2. **Request Parsing:** Incoming HTTP requests are parsed to extract the target server and resource.
3. **Forwarding & Response:** The proxy forwards the request to the destination server and relays the response back to the client.
4. **LRU Caching:** Frequently accessed responses are stored in memory using an LRU caching mechanism. Cached responses are served instantly if available.
5. **Thread Synchronization:** Semaphores manage concurrent access to shared data structures, ensuring thread safety and preventing race conditions.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* 🔐 Add support for **HTTPS** using the CONNECT method.
* 📁 Implement **persistent disk-based caching** for long-term storage.
* 📊 Add detailed **logging and monitoring** features.
* 🧪 Include **automated unit testing** and performance benchmarking.
* ⚙️ Add configuration options (e.g., cache size, logging level) via command-line or config files.
